      <p>
            Each member that has been approved into a ward can view a ward list. This ward list shows all the other people who have 
            registered with your ward and who have taken a survey. Each member may also download a PDF version for printing and for 
            mobile devices.            
            <br />
            <br />
            This ward list contains emails and phone numbers, but those elements are left off if the member chooses
            not to publish his/her phone or email. The ward leadership will still recieve that information in other reports.            
            <br />
            <br />
            The ward list is also searchable by name and sortable by 3 types of sorts: Last Name, Gender/First Name, and by Residence.
