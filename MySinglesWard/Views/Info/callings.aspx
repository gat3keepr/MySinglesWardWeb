	<p>
		Wards can monitor the calling status of each of their members by using the 
        Manage Callings feature. Due to the large influx of members at specific times 
        during the year, leadership must extend many callings within a short period of time. This
		tool helps walk members through the process of being approved for a calling, called,
		sustained, and then set apart.</p>
	<p>
		Each ward comes with a set of default callings. These callings are organized into
		organizations and each organization can have leaders and co-leaders who have access
		to special stewardship documents.</p>
