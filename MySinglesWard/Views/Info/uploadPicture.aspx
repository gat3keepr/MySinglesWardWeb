      <p>
           After a member takes a survey, they are asked to upload a photo. The member gets to upload their own photo and that photo
           will be put on the ward list and the reports created for the ward leadership.  
           <br />
           <br />
           The member can upload any photo and then choose the area they want cropped out for their profile picture. If the ward already
           has pictures of their members, those pictures can be uploaded by a member of the bishopric or a clerk.
