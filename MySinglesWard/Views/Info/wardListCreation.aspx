    Automated Ward List Creation
</h1>
<br />
<p>
    Using the survey data, bishopric members and clerks can create a ward list PDF that includes the member's name, picture, phone, e-mail, and residence. 
    The ward list can be created sorted by last name, male/female, or by residence. 
    <br />
    <br />
    All ward members can download the ward list online by going to the online ward list page.
