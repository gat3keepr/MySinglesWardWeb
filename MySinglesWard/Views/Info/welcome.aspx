<h2>
		The Problem</h2>
	<p>
        MySinglesWard.com was developed after I served as Elder's Quorum President in my singles ward. 
        I felt the frustration of the bishopric and saw the enormous amount of work put into the collection and 
        organization of new information at the start of each semester. Member records need to be collected, ward 
        lists need to be created and everyone needs a calling. The standard method of gathering information is to 
        hand out a paper survey in Sunday school, elder’s quorum and relief society. However, these surveys are often 
        lost, are not filled out properly, or are not turned in at all. Eventually the information gets put into 
        big stacks of paper in the clerk’s office and it quickly becomes difficult to manage. The ward clerk takes 
        grainy photos that are copied multiple times, and the ward list finally gets distributed after several weeks. 
        The bishopric tries to know the members of the ward as soon as possible, but the information is slow, inaccurate, 
        and spread out in multiple places. It often takes wards several weeks or months to get everyone integrated into 
        MLS and to get callings. By the time the bishopric can match a name to a face, the semester is almost over and 
        the ward leadership has to start over again.

		The Solution</h2>
	<p>
		The solution is to move the entire process online to MySinglesWard.com. Ward members can submit their information 
        online and upload their own photo. The ward list is created instantly and can be accessed by leaders and ward 
        members. This list can be exported to a pdf format or to excel if someone wants a physical copy. MySinglesWard.com 
        has a calling management feature so bishopric members can see what callings need to be filled and who needs a calling. 
        This puts all of the ward member information into a single place making it easy to administer. Users have told us 
        that on average, it saves ward clerks an average of two hours every week.

        While the ward list and calling tracking services are the core features of the site, MySinglesWard.com offers much 
        more such as group notifications and report generation. Many more features will be available in the near future. 
        If you have any ideas or suggestions for the site, please email them to feedback@mysinglesward.com.
