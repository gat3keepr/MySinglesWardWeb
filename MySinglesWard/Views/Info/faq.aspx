	</p>
	<p class="question">
		Is MySinglesWard.com a singles ward version of Facebook?
	</p>
	<p class="answer">
		MySinglesWard.com is not a social media application. It has been designed to help
		with the administration of singles wards and not the socializing of its members.</p>
	<p class="question">
		How do we get our members to take the survey?
	</p>
	<p class="answer">
		The idea is to make it as simple as possible for the members in your ward. Bringing
		multiple laptops to church and catching members before they leave has proven to
		work the best. When you would have your members fill out "member data sheets" is
		when you should have them fill out the member survey.</p>
