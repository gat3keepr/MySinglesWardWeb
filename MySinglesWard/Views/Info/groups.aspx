      <p>
           Groups allow ward and stake leaders to easily send notifications to a large amount of people. Members choose choose how they will get 
           notifications from the ward (e-mail and/or SMS) and what organizations they want to recieve notifications from. 
           <br />
           <br />
           When a group is created, it is put into one of six categories: Stake, Ward, Elders Quorum, Relief Society, Activities and FHE. One or two group 
           leaders are assigned and those group leaders can send notifications to the people who join their group. Stake, Bishopric, Elders 
           Quorum Presidents, Relief Society Presidents, Activities leaders, and FHE leaders can create groups and assign leaders.
